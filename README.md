# Kiwikit Pico Baseboard

This board provides an easy-to-solder all-throughole 10cm x 10cm 2-layer board which is used in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi Pico for basic, fun experimentation!

Features include:
* Three general purpose buttons and a reset button,
* Two general purpose LEDs and a power LED,
* An I2C SSD1306 Screen,
* An I2C AT24 EEPROM
* An LDR for Analog experimentation,
* And a bunch more expansion ports, two of which are arranged to work with cheap SD card and accelerometer modules!

## Usage

You'll need to use this project in tandem with my `kiwih_kicad` Kicad repository.
